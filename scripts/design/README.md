# The Design Reader

`design.sh` reads a design file's decisions and answers the question every stage after it asks: is this settled, or
does something still need deciding?

## Why it exists

A design file exists to be *finished before the plan starts*. Its whole value is that the judgment calls — what
happens when the database is down, what a duplicate request does, what the migration does to existing rows — are
answered while they still cost a paragraph, instead of after twenty-five checklist items depend on them.

That only holds if "finished" is checkable. Left to a reading, a `must-decide` slips through, a decision arrives
with a basis but no answer, or an assumption is written with nothing behind it — and the cost lands later, wherever
someone invents their own answer to the same question. `settled` is the one-word verdict anything downstream can
gate on, and `validate` is the shape check that keeps the format worth gating on.

It stores nothing of its own and edits nothing: the design file stays the single source of truth, and a decision is
answered by whoever makes it.

## Where it lives

It ships **with the skills that use it**, at `scripts/design/` under the plugin root — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` once
installed, `.claude/` in a plain checkout. `design-parse.awk` sits beside it and is found relative to the script, so
the pair travels together.

The **design file** is found the other way round, from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (falling back to the working
directory). Once installed, this script runs from a cache directory outside any checkout, so nothing about the
project can be derived from where the script is.

## Usage

Run it with bash, from anywhere inside the project:

```
<plugin>/scripts/design/design.sh settled
<plugin>/scripts/design/design.sh validate
<plugin>/scripts/design/design.sh show D4 D7
```

| Command        | Effect                                                                                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `settled`      | Exit 0 when nothing is still `must-decide`; exit 1 and list what is.                    |
| `status`       | How many decisions rest on each basis.                                                  |
| `show <ID>...` | One decision: its question, `Answer:` and `Basis:`. Several print blank-line separated. |
| `validate`     | See [What `validate` checks](#what-validate-checks).                                    |

Exit codes: **0** done, **1** no such entry, not settled, or `validate` found problems, **2** bad usage.

`--file <design>` picks the design. Without it, the single `docs/<n>-<task>/design.md` is used — a task owns a
directory, holding `design.md` and `plan.md`. An archived design under `docs/implemented/<n>-<task>/design.md`
has to be named explicitly.

### Decision entries

An entry is three lines — the question, the answer, and what the answer rests on:

```
- **D4:** What does the caller see when the database is unavailable mid-write?
- Answer: PersistenceFailedException propagates; the transaction rolls back and nothing is stored.
- Basis: assumed — ExpenseRepositoryAdapter classifies every non-constraint DataAccessException this way.
```

`D<n>` is assigned once and never renumbered. The four bases and what each obliges belong to the design format,
defined by the `design-task` skill this ships with; a worked example is at
`.claude/skills/design-task/example-design.md`.

### What `validate` checks

| Check                                                                  | Catches                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The `**Affected Modules:**` line, and every required section, in order | a design missing the context the plan reads it for                      |
| Duplicate `D` IDs, an entry outside the Decisions section              | a decision nothing can address                                          |
| A Design Findings row numbered below the row above it                  | a row inserted at the wrong line — the table reads in ascending order |
| A missing or repeated `Answer:` / `Basis:`                             | an entry no gate can classify                                           |
| A basis that is not one of the four, or one with nothing after it      | an assumption with no evidence — a `must-decide` in disguise          |
| A `must-decide` carrying an answer, or any other basis carrying none   | an entry whose two halves disagree                                      |
| A Design Findings section with no `Grilled (<date>):` line             | a design the grill never saw                                            |
| A missing or out-of-order section, `## Acceptance Scenarios` included  | a design a plan cannot be written from                                  |

A `must-decide` entry is **not** a problem here: a design in flight is expected to have them, and that is exactly
what `settled` is for. `validate` asks whether the file is well-formed; `settled` asks whether it is finished.

A clean run prints the design's size — `####` sections under **Proposed Solution**, scenarios, decisions,
findings. The counts are a mirror, not a gate: a design carrying more than one subject is split into one task per
subject (`design-task`, **One Subject per Task**), and the counts are what show the moment to do it.

Placeholder values — empty, `-`, `—`, `TBD`, `N/A` — count as unfilled, the same set `plan.sh` rejects in a
`given:`/`when:`/`then:`.

### Portability

The constraints are `plan.sh`'s, for the same reasons: **`bash`, `awk`, `sed`, `git`, `find`** and nothing else, no
GNU-only spellings, strict POSIX awk (checked with `gawk --posix`), Git Bash on Windows, `*.sh` and `*.awk` pinned
to LF in `.gitattributes`, and `design.sh` committed with mode `755`. `bash design.sh …` works either way.

Whoever installs this has to allow the script in their own permission settings, since permissions are the
consumer's and not the plugin's. A prefix rule is matched as a literal string, so a quoted path matches no rule
written bare:

| Install        | Allow rule                                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| plain checkout | `Bash(bash .claude/scripts/design/design.sh:*)`  |
| plugin         | `Bash(bash <root>/scripts/design/design.sh:*)`   |
| plugin, quoted | `Bash(bash "<root>/scripts/design/design.sh":*)` |

`<root>` is the directory the plugin was installed to, written out in full. Allow the quoted spelling as well as
the bare one, or an agent that quotes an absolute path is refused by a rule that appears to cover it. Drop the
`bash ` prefix for a rule covering the script invoked directly.

## Where it stops

It parses the design's **shape**, not its meaning. It cannot tell whether an `assumed` basis is true, whether the
evidence cited actually says what the entry claims, or whether the decision is a good one. A well-formed design
that is wrong about the codebase validates cleanly — that is what the `grill-design` pass and the reader are for.

Bullets inside fenced code blocks are skipped, so a design quoting its own entry format does not acquire phantom
decisions from the example.
