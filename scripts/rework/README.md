# The Rework Reader

`rework.sh` reads and updates a rework's checklist by step ID — what is done, what one step says,
marking a step done, and whether the file's grammar holds.

## Why it exists

A rework's step format is decided by its kind. Five kinds, and each owes some labelled lines and may not carry
others: an `extract` owes `frozen:` and `cover:`, a `tests` step owes `survives:` and may not name a production
file at all. Every one of those mistakes is silent — a stray `frozen:` on a `tests` step does nothing, and a
missing `proves:` turns a `pin` into a claim nobody checked.

The second reason is addressing. A step handed to a sub-agent has to arrive as the file wrote it, not as a
prompt remembered it. `show` is what makes that possible.

There is no scheduling command. Steps run in ID order, and `needs:` only says which earlier work a run depends
on, so there is nothing for a `next` to compute.

## Where it lives

It ships **with the skill that uses it**, at `scripts/rework/` under the plugin root —
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` once installed, `.claude/` in a plain checkout. `rework-parse.awk` sits beside it and is
found relative to the script, so the pair travels together.

The **rework file** is found the other way round, from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (falling back to the
working directory). Once installed, this script runs from a cache directory outside any checkout, so nothing
about the project can be derived from where the script is.

## Usage

Run it with bash, from anywhere inside the project:

```
<plugin>/scripts/rework/rework.sh status
<plugin>/scripts/rework/rework.sh show R03
<plugin>/scripts/rework/rework.sh tick R02 R04
<plugin>/scripts/rework/rework.sh validate
```

| Command        | Effect                                                                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `status`       | Done/total, and the IDs still open.                                                        |
| `show <ID>...` | One step: its header and everything indented under it. Several print blank-line separated. |
| `tick <ID>...` | Mark the steps done. Every ID is resolved before any is written.                           |
| `validate`     | See [What `validate` checks](#what-validate-checks).                                       |

Exit codes: **0** done, **1** no such step or `validate` found problems, **2** bad usage.

`--file <rework>` names the file, and is accepted on every subcommand. Without one, the single `rework.md` in
flight under `docs/` is used. A multi-module rework's `<module>/steps.md`, an archived rework under
`docs/implemented/`, and one of two reworks in flight at once all have to be named explicitly.

### Step IDs

A step is `- [ ] <ID> · <kind> · <text>`, the ID being a letter prefix and a number — `R01`, `R02`. The kinds
and the numbering rule belong to the rework format, defined by the `rework` skill this ships with.

`files:` and `test-files:` carry their paths as bullets under the label rather than as text beside it, so their
label line is empty by design. Every other label keeps its value on its own line.

### What `validate` checks

| Check                                                            | Catches                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Duplicate IDs, a step with no ID                                 | a step nothing can address                            |
| A kind the format does not define                                | a typo that silently exempts the step from every rule |
| A labelled line the kind does not take                           | `frozen:` on a `tests` step, which does nothing       |
| A labelled line the kind owes and does not carry                 | a `pin` with no `proves:` — a claim nobody checked  |
| A `pin` naming neither `files:` nor `test-files:`                | a check or setting that edits nothing                 |
| A value left empty, `TBD`, `—`, or still in `<angle brackets>` | a step agent given no instruction                     |
| A `files:` or `test-files:` with no bullet under it              | a boundary that names nothing                         |
| A `survives:` with nothing after the middot                      | a scenario that never said what it was proven against |
| `needs:` or `disables:` naming a step nothing defines            | a reference to a step that was renumbered or dropped  |
| An Open Question whose `- A:` is empty                           | a run about to start on a decision nobody made        |

**A duplicate ID's own block is not judged.** The second `R01` is reported and its lines are skipped, since
attributing them to an ID that already means something else would report the same step twice. Fix the ID and run
again.

Bullets inside fenced code blocks are skipped, so a rework quoting the step format does not acquire phantom
steps from the example.

## Where it stops

It parses the file's **shape**, not its meaning. It cannot tell whether a `frozen:` test actually reaches the
body being moved, whether a `survives:` scenario is the one that matters, or whether the `measures:` number is
the right one. Those are the questions phase 2's approval and the step's own mutation exist to answer.

## Portability

It runs on macOS, Linux and Windows. What that costs:

- **`bash`, `awk`, `sed`, `git`, `find`, `grep`** — nothing else, and no GNU-only spellings. The parser is
  strict POSIX awk, so `mawk` and BSD `awk` serve as well as `gawk`.
- **Edits go through a sibling temp file, not `sed -i`**, whose argument differs between GNU and BSD.
- **Windows** needs a **Git Bash** prompt, which supplies all of the above.
- `*.sh` and `*.awk` must be pinned to LF in `.gitattributes` — a CRLF checkout fails on the first line — and
  `rework.sh` must be committed with mode `755`, or a Unix clone cannot run it. `bash rework.sh …` works either
  way.

Whoever installs this has to allow the script in their own permission settings, since permissions are the
consumer's and not the plugin's. A prefix rule is matched as a literal string, so a quoted path matches no rule
written bare:

| Install        | Allow rule                                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| plain checkout | `Bash(bash .claude/scripts/rework/rework.sh:*)`  |
| plugin         | `Bash(bash <root>/scripts/rework/rework.sh:*)`   |
| plugin, quoted | `Bash(bash "<root>/scripts/rework/rework.sh":*)` |

`<root>` is the directory the plugin was installed to, written out in full. Allow the quoted spelling as well as
the bare one, or an agent that quotes an absolute path is refused by a rule that appears to cover it. Drop the
`bash ` prefix for a rule covering the script invoked directly.
