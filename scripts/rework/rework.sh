Usage:
  <plugin>/scripts/rework/rework.sh status   [--file <rework>]
  <plugin>/scripts/rework/rework.sh show     <ID>... [--file <rework>]
  <plugin>/scripts/rework/rework.sh tick     <ID>... [--file <rework>]
  <plugin>/scripts/rework/rework.sh validate [--file <rework> | <rework directory>]

Commands:
  status    Done/total, and the IDs still open.
  show      One step: its header and everything indented under it. Several IDs print in order,
            separated by a blank line.
  tick      Mark the steps done. Several IDs are one batch: all are resolved before any is written,
            so a name nothing defines ticks none of them.
  validate  Duplicate or missing IDs, an unrecognized kind, a line the kind does not take, a line
            the kind owes and does not carry, a placeholder value, a "survives:" naming no tier,
            "needs:"/"disables:" pointing at a step nothing defines, and an unanswered Open Question.

--file defaults to the single rework.md in flight under docs/. A <module>/steps.md, and an
archived rework under docs/implemented/, are addressed by passing --file explicitly. validate given
the rework's directory validates rework.md and every steps file under it in one call; a step named
with its file ("shared/steps.md · R01") is not resolved across files.

Exit codes: 0 done - 1 nothing matched or validate found problems - 2 bad usage.
