Usage:
  <plugin>/scripts/upgrade/upgrade.sh status   [--file <upgrade>]
  <plugin>/scripts/upgrade/upgrade.sh show     <ID>... [--file <upgrade>]
  <plugin>/scripts/upgrade/upgrade.sh tick     <ID>... [--file <upgrade>]
  <plugin>/scripts/upgrade/upgrade.sh validate [--file <upgrade> | <upgrade directory>]

Commands:
  status    Done/total, the IDs still open, and the IDs abandoned.
  show      One step: its header and everything indented under it. Several IDs print in order,
            separated by a blank line.
  tick      Mark the steps done. Several IDs are one batch: all are resolved before any is written,
            so a name nothing defines ticks none of them.
  validate  Duplicate or missing IDs, an unrecognized kind, a line the kind does not take, a line
            the kind owes and does not carry, a placeholder value, a "change:" naming no place,
            "needs:" pointing at a step nothing defines, an attempt missing a line or its evidence,
            an attempt filed under no step, and an unanswered Open Question.

--file defaults to the single upgrade.md in flight under docs/. A <module>/steps.md, and an
archived upgrade under docs/implemented/, are addressed by passing --file explicitly. validate given
the upgrade's directory validates upgrade.md and every steps file under it in one call; a step named
with its file ("shared/steps.md · U01") is not resolved across files.

Exit codes: 0 done - 1 nothing matched or validate found problems - 2 bad usage.
