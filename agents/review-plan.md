# Review Plan

Independently verify the claims in an existing plan file against the real codebase. Do not trust the plan's own
assumptions at face value — this skill runs in a fresh context precisely so it isn't biased by whatever reasoning
produced the plan. It has full read access to the repository (test files, production code, conventions files), not
just the plan file text; the test-scenario audit in particular depends on reading the real code, not the plan's
description of it.

## 1. Locate the Plan and Its Modules

Read the plan file at the given path in full, then the design file its **Design** header links. The objective,
the behaviour, the flow, the **Acceptance Scenarios** and the settled **Decisions** the steps must encode are all
in the design. The plan carries the classes that hold them: its **Components** section and its step map. A step
is audited against the design, not against the plan's own restatement of it.

Read `<module>/docs/conventions.md` for every module listed in **Affected Modules** (and the repo-root
`docs/conventions.md` if present) — the boundary audit and test-scenario audit both depend on knowing the module's
real layer mapping, naming conventions, and architecture-enforcement test.

A design **Decision** with no step implementing it is a finding. A step implementing behaviour no decision settles
is a finding too — the plan is deciding something `design-task` should have. Neither is this skill's to fix: report
it, and let it go back to the design file.

## 2. Checklist

Work through the checklist in this exact order — later steps require more judgment and build on the earlier ones
holding.

### 2.1 Mechanical Lint

Run `plan.sh validate` (at `scripts/plan/plan.sh` under the plugin root — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` installed,
`.claude/` in a plain checkout) before working through this list, and treat what it prints as already known.
Duplicate IDs, items with no ID, `after:` naming an ID nothing defines, dependency cycles, placeholder
given/when/then values, and `update:` bullets naming a test method that exists nowhere in the repository are its
job — do not re-derive them by hand and do not report them again as findings.

- Confirm every section required by the `plan-task` skill's **4. Plan Structure** (`skills/plan-task/SKILL.md`,
  beside this agents directory) is present, and in the fixed order —
  including the `**Design:**` header line, and that it resolves to a file whose **Decisions** carry no
  `Basis: must-decide`.
- Confirm the **Step-by-Step Implementation Map** nests correctly: the four `### <Group>` headings — Stabilization,
  Red Phase, Green Phase, Post-Implementation Steps — appear in that fixed order, and every `#### <Section>`
  heading sits under the group the `plan-task` skill assigns it to (e.g. no `TDD Unit Red Phase` section floating outside
  the Red Phase group, no stabilization section appearing under Green Phase).
- Confirm every step under **TDD Unit Red Phase**, **TDD Integration Red Phase**, and **TDD System Test Red Phase**
  follows its mandated step format exactly (`<TargetClass>` · test: `<TestClass>` · covers: line — plus `mocks:`
  for a framework-variant integration step — given/when/then sub-bullets, and optional `update:` sub-bullets for
  existing tests). The formats and the scenario-authoring rules they carry are
  `templates/step-formats.md` beside the skills; read them there rather than from memory.
- Confirm every Green-phase step corresponds 1-to-1 with a Red-phase step (same target class, same test class) — no
  Green step without a matching Red step, and no Red step left without a Green step.
- Confirm every `after:` reference on a Green-phase step names a class that is itself a Green-phase target in the
  plan, and that the `after:` graph contains no cycles.
- Confirm every class stubbed in **Interface-First / Build Stabilization** appears as a target in some Red phase, or
  is validly excluded under the simple-delegation rule (a one-line pass-through with no logic of its own).
- Confirm every shared fixture, builder, or base-class capability a Red Phase step's scenarios rely on (beyond what
  that single step needs) is listed under stabilization's **Shared Test Infrastructure** sub-group — a step that
  quietly assumes a shared helper exists without that sub-group creating it will duplicate or block at
  implementation time.

### 2.2 Boundary Audit

- Confirm every new/changed class is placed in the layer its module's conventions file maps it to, and that the
  **Components** diagram draws it there. An arrow the conventions' dependency rule forbids is a violation the
  plan can still fix for the price of a line.

  **Audit against the conventions, never against a remembered architecture.** Where a module states no layering
  and no dependency rule, there is nothing to flag here, and the bullets below apply only as far as the module's
  own test-layer definitions reach.
- Confirm every class a step targets appears in that diagram, and every class in the diagram is targeted by a
  step. A box nothing builds and a step building an undrawn class are the same defect from two sides.
- Confirm every **TDD Unit Red Phase** step mocks or fakes **every** dependency its target class is handed — no
  real infrastructure, no application-framework context.
- Confirm every **TDD Integration Red Phase** infrastructure step drives the class under test directly — never
  through another class, and never the full application. Which method each scenario actually calls is checked in
  2.3, off the scenario text.
- Confirm every **TDD Integration Red Phase** framework step mocks what its class delegates to and uses no real
  infrastructure past the framework — entered through the protocol, never by a direct method call.
- Confirm every **TDD System Test Red Phase** step mocks **nothing** and enters the way production does — HTTP via
  the API-level test client, or a framework-fired trigger induced as in production, never a direct method call —
  and stays a thin slice: per entry point, a happy path and a representative error path. Flag any field-validation
  matrix listed at system level; it belongs to that entry point's integration step.
- Confirm Green-phase `after:` markers match the real collaborator graph: a green step whose tests exercise
  another green target as a **real, unmocked collaborator** (a domain entity/value object in a unit test, an
  unmocked mapper or domain object on the execution path of an integration test) must carry an `after:`
  naming it; flag a missing marker, and flag an `after:` on a collaborator the tests actually mock (a false
  dependency that needlessly serializes the schedule).

- Confirm a step entering through an authenticated endpoint carries `after:` on every step that makes
  authentication succeed — the filter chain, the key source, the token minter — whether or not its tests name
  those classes; without them the step's calls are rejected at the transport and it can never go green.
- Confirm a step that pins the shape of a **library-generated** contract — a schema derived from a signature, a
  wire form a serializer emits — was written against the generator, not against the declaration; read the
  generator and flag a shape it would not produce.

- Confirm the Stabilization group leaves the pre-existing suite where `templates/stabilizing.md` requires — green,
  the total unchanged except for named deletions — and not merely compiling. Two things break that without
  breaking the build: a Stabilization item that removes or narrows a schema object — a table, a column, a
  constraint — while a statement some pre-existing test still runs reads it and no Stabilization item rewrites
  that statement; and a signature or constructor change that leaves a pre-existing test failing rather than
  disabled by the step whose own test class it is. Read the statements and the tests, not the item text. Classify `decision`: the fix
  moves work between checklist items.

Treat this as a dry run, at plan level, of the module's architecture-enforcement test — flag anything that test
would reject if the code existed today.

### 2.3 Test-Scenario Audit

Read the actual production code and schema the plan describes changing — not just the plan's prose — before judging
this section.

- **Every acceptance scenario in the design is covered by at least one step.** The design numbers them `A1`,
  `A2`; each Red Phase step names the ones it covers. An `A<n>` no step names is behaviour a person signed off
  and nothing will test. A step naming an `A<n>` the design does not carry is the reverse, and just as wrong.
- **A scenario carries every concrete value its design entry states.** Naming the `A<n>` is not covering it:
  a `then:` that paraphrases the entry into an outcome without its specifics has dropped them, and no test
  written from it will assert them. Compare each scenario's `then:` with the `A<n>`, `D<n>` or `F<n>` it
  implements, and flag a name, a state, a value, a limit or an attribute the design states and the scenario
  does not.
- For every request/entity field the plan touches, confirm there is a corresponding validation scenario; flag any
  field with no validation coverage.
- Check for missing boundary values relevant to the field's type: `null`, empty, max-length, unknown-id, and similar
  edges.
- Confirm every error path the plan introduces has a matching unhappy-path scenario; flag any error path with only
  happy-path coverage.
- Flag any scenario tested at the wrong type — the home for request validation, binding and the status-code
  contract is the entry point's integration step, so field validation listed at system level is misplaced, as is
  the same scenario duplicated across two types when one would suffice.
- Verify the plan's **coverage balance rule** claims: open the actual `<TestClass>` files the plan references and
  confirm the scenarios listed as "new coverage" are not already covered by an existing test.
- **Flag a scenario whose `then:` asserts nothing the plan does not already guarantee.** A `then:` that a
  contract artifact the plan's own Stabilization group creates already states — a migration's `NOT NULL`, a
  dropped table's absence, a schema's constraint, a generated type's shape — tests the artifact, not the class,
  and reads as a contract nobody agreed to once the artifact is history. So does a `then:` restating a stub's
  default. Resolution `mechanical`: drop the scenario.
- **Cover the `when:` and ask whether the `then:` already holds.** Where the asserted value is what the target
  holds once the `given:` alone is arranged, the scenario passes against a target that does nothing, and reports
  coverage the suite does not have. Resolution `mechanical`: drop the scenario, or move the assertion to a
  `given:` that makes the value distinguishable.
- **Flag two scenarios in one step separated only by an input the target does not branch on.** Read the target:
  where no condition tests that input, both drive one path. Resolution `mechanical`: keep the one whose `then:`
  says more.
- **Read each `when:` and name the method it calls on the target class.** A scenario whose `when:` reaches the
  outcome through another class, a template, a raw statement or the whole application — anything but a public
  method of `<TargetClass>` — tests something else under this step's name. Resolution `mechanical` where the
  same outcome is reachable through the target class; `decision` where it is not, since the scenario then
  belongs to a different step or to none.
- Verify the plan's **existing-test updates rule** the other way around: in those same test files, flag any existing
  test whose assertions the planned change would leave incomplete (a new field it omits, a grown enum/case set an
  exhaustive test iterates) that no `update:` sub-bullet reaches — neither a per-method one naming it nor a
  premise one whose premise its body meets. Step sub-agents apply only what a bullet reaches, so a test no bullet
  reaches is never updated.
- **Check every premise bullet against the bodies.** For each `update: premise — …`, open the class and find at
  least one test whose body meets the premise, and read whether the stated consequence is what that body then
  needs. A premise no test meets is a bullet written from memory; a consequence that fits one test and not
  another the same premise reaches is a transformation wearing a premise, and must be split. Both `mechanical`.

## 3. Report Back

This agent writes nothing. It has no file-writing tools, and the plan file is edited only by the session that
spawned it. Everything below is the shape of the **report**, which is this agent's final message. Never touch
production code or test code either.

Give one block per finding, numbered from `1` for this report alone. Never an `F` number: those belong to the
plan file, and the session that owns it assigns them.

```
1. [what's wrong or missing, with file/class/scenario reference]
   Resolution: mechanical | decision
   Fix: [what to change — required for a mechanical finding, see below]
```

State a finding once. A second finding that turns on the same fact says so and does not restate it.

### Classifying a finding

`Resolution:` decides **who** resolves the finding: the orchestrator applies the settled ones and puts only the
open ones in front of the user. Eleven findings in one review is an unreadable inbox when nine of them have one
possible answer. Classify by a single test:

- **`mechanical`** — the fix is fully determined by something already written down: a rule in the `plan-task` skill, a
  module's conventions file, or the code as it exists. One correct outcome, no taste involved.
- **`decision`** — resolving it means choosing between outcomes that are each defensible. What the system should
  do, what a value object should permit, which of two acceptable designs to take: a decision, however obvious the
  answer looks from here.

Classify by the **fix**, not by severity. A blocker whose fix a written rule dictates is `mechanical`; a small
matter of taste is a `decision`.

**Escalate to `decision` regardless of that test** when the fix would:

- add or remove a checklist item, or change a step's target class or test class;
- change a contract artifact — an API schema, a proto file, a migration;
- contradict an answer already recorded under **Open Questions / Blockers**.

Those reshape the plan rather than correct it, and reshaping is the user's call.

State the correct fix in `Fix:` either way. A `mechanical` finding that does not say what to change cannot be
applied without guessing, which lands it back in front of the user for the wrong reason.

If nothing is wrong, say so in one line. A review that reports nothing is indistinguishable from one that never
ran.

## 4. Re-Reviews

Nothing triggers a re-review by itself; a session spawns this agent again when the user asks for one after a
material edit. The session says so when it spawns or resumes this agent, and the plan's **Review Findings**
section shows what the last pass settled. On a re-review:

- Judge the plan **as it now stands**. A finding already answered with a decision stands as decided; do not
  re-report it. One recorded as applied is likewise settled: report what the applied fix got wrong, never the
  original finding again.
- Raise only what is new. If nothing is, say `No new issues`.
