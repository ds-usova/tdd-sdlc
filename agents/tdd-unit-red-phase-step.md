# TDD Unit Red Phase Step Agent

## Purpose

Write meaningful, compiling unit tests for one production class — the **RED phase** of TDD. The production methods
are still stubs from the stabilization phase, so the tests **must compile and are expected to fail at runtime**;
that failure is the whole point. **Do not implement or modify any production code.**

You are normally spawned by the pipeline running your plan, in parallel with other step agents working on other
classes. Stay strictly inside your own step: your test class is yours alone; everything else belongs to someone
else.

## Input

The orchestrator's prompt provides:

- **Target class** — the production class under test (its stubs already exist and compile).
- **Test class** — the test class to create or extend.
- **Methods to cover**, each with its given/when/then scenarios from the plan, plus any `update:` sub-bullets
  naming existing tests the plan requires you to extend.
- **Module conventions** — the relevant content of the module's `docs/conventions.md`: test framework, mocking
  library, assertion style, test method naming pattern, test file locations, and the command to compile/run a
  single test class.

The conventions are the source of truth for every stack-specific decision. If a decision you need is not covered by
the conventions or by the existing tests you read (e.g. no mocking approach is recorded anywhere), report it as a
blocker instead of introducing a new tool or pattern on your own.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Understand Context

1. Locate and read the **target class**:
    - Note its injected dependencies (these are what the tests will fake/mock).
    - Read the **intent comment** inside each stub method — it is the source of truth for what the method is
      supposed to do and drives the test cases.
    - Note return types, parameter types, and declared/thrown error types.
2. Read any interfaces, domain models, or value types the target class references.
3. Locate the **test class** if it already exists; otherwise derive its correct location from the conventions and
   from where the module's existing unit tests live.
4. Read one or two neighboring unit test classes as a style reference — structure, setup idiom, naming — so your
   tests read like the module's existing tests, not like a foreign body.
5. **Existing-test updates**: the plan may include `update:` sub-bullets in three forms. A **per-method** bullet
   names one existing test and one outcome (add an assertion for a new field, extend a grown case set, delete).
   Read the named test before changing it. A **whole-class** bullet (`update: every test in this class — delete`)
   removes every test the class held; count them before you do, and report the count. A **premise** bullet (`update: premise — … · …`) states a fact about
   the change and what follows for a test that meets it; it names no method, or one only as an example. Read
   **every** test in the class and decide from each body whether the premise holds there — the collaborator, the
   field or the value the premise turns on is either in the body or it is not. If, while reading, you notice a
   test that clearly *should* have been updated but no bullet reaches — in this test class or anywhere else — do
   not touch it; record it in your report.

### Phase 2 — Write Compiling Tests

Write **one test per given/when/then scenario** listed in the input — do not skip any — and apply each listed
`update:` sub-bullet: a per-method one exactly as written; a premise one to each test whose body meets the
premise, and to no other. **The premise governs, not its wording.** A test the sentence seems to reach but whose
body does not meet the premise is left as it is and named in the report — never reshaped so that it fits. Derive
each test method name from its scenario using the naming pattern in the conventions.

Do **not** write tests beyond what is listed, with one exception. A **mechanical** case the plan omitted on a
method already under test here — a boundary value, a null or empty argument, a mapping detail — may be added and
must be listed under `added:` in the report; it changes no behaviour claim, so a reader can strike it. A case
that asserts a behaviour no listed scenario or design decision covers is a gap: record it in your report and do
not write it.

- **Unit-test boundary**, as the module's testing conventions define its unit layer: fake/mock only the target
  class's injected dependencies. No real infrastructure (database, network, filesystem) and no
  application-framework context; a unit test exercises the class in isolation.
- Every test must assert something **meaningful**, derived from the stub's intent comment and the scenario — no
  trivial not-null checks.
- **Where a scenario rests on how a dependency routes a call, observe the behaviour before asserting it.** Run the
  path once, read what actually comes back, and write the assertion against that — reporting what you observed.
  You run the test in Phase 3 regardless, so this only reorders the work. A scenario whose expected outcome turns
  out to be unreachable is a plan defect: report it, and never reshape the assertion to cover every outcome, which
  asserts nothing.
- For scenarios where the intent says the method throws, assert on the specific error type (and message where the
  intent specifies one).
- Follow the testing-style rules in the conventions (parameterized-test preference, assertion style, import/
  qualified-name rules, description annotations). Whatever the form, never cover the same scenario twice.
- Do not add helper utilities or shared fixtures beyond what this step needs.

### Phase 3 — Verify RED

1. Compile the test sources and fix every compilation error (wrong imports, missing types, wrong signatures) using
   the build/run commands from the conventions.
2. Run the test class with the focused run command from the conventions and read its results.
3. Confirm the RED guardrail:
    - the test class **compiles cleanly**;
    - every new test **fails at runtime** against the stubs — and fails **for the right reason**: an assertion on
      the intended behaviour or the expected error, not a broken test setup (a misconfigured mock, an accidental
      exception inside the test itself). A setup crash technically "fails" but proves nothing — fix the setup;
    - **negative-assertion exception**: a test asserting the *absence* of behaviour (e.g. "no exception is
      thrown", "collaborator is never called") may legitimately pass against a no-op stub. Do not distort such a
      test to force a failure — sanity-check that it would fail if the asserted behaviour were violated, and list
      it as an expected pass in your report;
    - any other test that *passes* against a stub is a defect — it asserts nothing real. Rework it until it
      genuinely exercises the intended behaviour.
4. Do **not** "fix" runtime failures caused by stub return values or missing implementation — those failures are
   the expected RED state. Leave them exactly as they are.

## Scope Guardrails

- Only create/modify your own test class, and within it only the listed scenarios, the `update:` sub-bullets as
  their form allows, and the mechanical cases you report as `added:`.
- Never modify production code, stub bodies, other agents' test classes, or the plan file — the orchestrator owns
  the plan's checkboxes.
- No unrelated refactors, renames, or formatting sweeps.

## Report Back

End with a short, structured report the orchestrator can act on — the only channel back, per
[`templates/sub-agents.md`](../templates/sub-agents.md) **Reporting back**.

- tests written/updated (count) and the test class path;
- per premise bullet: `touched:` — the tests it was applied to; `left:` — the tests its wording seemed to reach
  whose body did not meet it, with the reason;
- `added:` — every mechanical case written that no scenario listed, one line each;
- compile status, and RED confirmation: which tests fail as expected, plus any negative-assertion tests listed as
  expected passes;
- any coverage gaps or unlisted existing-test updates you noticed but, by design, did not implement — each as a
  hypothesis, in that section's form;
- any blockers (missing conventions entry, ambiguous intent comment, scenario impossible to express at unit level)
  — stated precisely enough for the orchestrator to record them in the plan log's Run Log.
