# Implement Plan — Pipeline Agent

Run one plan, start to finish, through the stages below. The default scope is the **whole plan**. If you were
given a single `#### <Section>`, run only that section's items, under the rules of the stage its group maps to,
and stop there; scope every `plan.sh next` with `--section`.

## What You Are Given

- **the plan file path** — the only plan you read items from, tick, or edit;
- **your module's baseline figures** — the suite's total and skipped counts, measured before anything changed.

Everything else you establish from the plan and the conventions it names.

**Two gates already ran above you, and you repeat neither.** The level that spawned you checked that every plan
in the task is ready — its design settled, its questions answered, its findings actioned — and measured every
module's baseline. The tree has moved since, so a fresh measurement would not be a baseline. The figures you were
handed are what your stage guardrails compare against.

## Role: Orchestrator Only

You coordinate; you do not write production or test code. All implementation work is delegated to sub-agents via
the **`Agent` tool**. Your own jobs are:

- reading the plan and the conventions it names,
- spawning sub-agents with the right instructions and step context,
- running the guardrail verifications between stages,
- ticking checkboxes in the plan file (**only you edit the plan file and its log** — never a sub-agent, since
  several run concurrently),
- recording blockers, notes and unrelated failures in the **Run Log** of the `plan-log.md` beside the plan.

**The Run Log is where the run writes.** An entry is `- **B<n> (<ID>):** what happened`, appended after the
last, `<ID>` the step it belongs to. `plan.sh block` writes one for a blocker, with a `- Resolved:` line you
fill when it is settled; a note nothing waits on — a test that passed red for a reason, a boundary a step
widened, an unrelated failure — you append yourself, with no `Resolved:` line, creating the `## Run Log`
heading after **Review Findings** when no entry exists yet. The plan's **Open Questions**
gains nothing from a run: a question is what the plan waits on before it starts.

**You spawn step agents and nothing else.** You never spawn another pipeline, and you never read another plan.

**Return when the plan is finished, genuinely blocked, or holding a wave you have just launched.** How a spawn,
a resume and a suite run are waited for, which `model` a spawn passes, and how a rule is handed to a step agent
is [`templates/sub-agents.md`](../templates/sub-agents.md), read before the first spawn. You run as a sub-agent,
so its **hand the wave back** shape is yours. Started a suite? Read its verdict before you return. Blocked and
needing a decision? That is a result — return, and say what you need.

**A measurement is not repeated over an unchanged tree.** Where the last run was the module's full suite and
nothing has been written since — a wave's verification followed by the stage's exit check, the refactor
guardrail followed by the whole-plan guardrail with no post-implementation change between — that run answers the
next guardrail: read its output again rather than re-running it. A run filtered to some classes, or a tree any
agent has written to since, answers nothing.

**A step agent's model** is the one the module conventions name for executing work; the refactor agent's is the
one for deciding work.

## Reading What You Run

1. Read the plan file in full. The `## Step-by-Step Implementation Map` section nests two levels: four
   `### <Group>` headings — **Stabilization**, **Red Phase**, **Green Phase**, **Post-Implementation Steps**, in
   that fixed order — each containing its `#### <Section>` blocks. Collect every `#### <Section>` block, grouped by
   its parent `### <Group>`, and its unchecked `- [ ]` items. The four groups map directly onto the stages below:
   Stabilization → Stage 1, Red Phase → Stage 2, Green Phase → Stage 3, Post-Implementation Steps → Stage 5.
2. Read `<module>/docs/conventions.md` for the module your plan implements (and the repo-root
   `docs/conventions.md` if present). The conventions file is the source of truth for the build command, the test
   commands per layer, the architecture-enforcement test, and file locations. Pass the relevant conventions along in
   every sub-agent prompt — sub-agents must not guess build commands.

**Addressing the plan.** Every checklist item carries an ID (`GU07`), and `plan.sh` — which ships with these
instructions at `scripts/plan/plan.sh`, under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` when installed as a plugin and under
`.claude/` in a plain checkout — is how you read and write them. Its README sits beside it.

**The plan file is a positional argument on every call, and it comes last.** There is no `--plan` flag. `tick` and
`show` take any number of IDs in one call and reject a shell loop around them, so batch the IDs rather than
iterating:

| Need                          | Command                                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Where the run stands          | `plan.sh status docs/<plan>.md`                                            |
| One item's text and scenarios | `plan.sh show GU07 GU08 docs/<plan>.md`                                    |
| What is spawnable right now   | `plan.sh next --group <group> docs/<plan>.md` (`--all` also shows waiting) |
| Mark an item done             | `plan.sh tick GU07 GU08 docs/<plan>.md`                                    |
| Leave it open, record why     | `plan.sh block GU07 "<reason>" docs/<plan>.md` — writes the log's next `B` |

**Always scope `next` to the stage you are running.** Unscoped, it advances to the next group the moment the
current one is fully ticked; scoped, `every item in scope is ticked` is the stage's completion signal.
`--section` narrows further and may be repeated. The flags' matching rules are the script's README.

Refer to items by ID in every sub-agent prompt and ask for the ID back in the report, so a tick is never matched
against wording that may have changed mid-run.

**Tick policy.** Tick with `plan.sh tick <ID>` and record blockers with `plan.sh block <ID> "<reason>"`; never
hand-edit a checkbox. Completed and verified in this run → `- [x]`; not done or blocked → keep `- [ ]`. An item
with several sub-tasks is ticked only when all are done. Never tick on a sub-agent's claim alone if the stage
guardrail later contradicts it — the guardrail wins.

**`plan.sh show <ID>` is also how a step's text reaches its sub-agent** — its target class, its test class, its
`covers:` list and its scenarios verbatim. Read it from there rather than extracting it from the plan file by
hand, which is a chance to paraphrase a scenario the agent is supposed to implement literally.

A plan whose items have no IDs predates this format: `plan.sh validate` will say so item by item. Add the IDs
first (you own plan edits), then proceed.

If the script is absent or the call is refused — by a hook or by the user at the prompt — fall back to editing the checkboxes directly and put
the case as one line in your final report, as [`scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md) says. Everything
below still applies; only the mechanics change, and `validate` is never run. Never stop for it — the skill that
spawned you has already told the user.

## Version Control

Whether this run commits at all, and how, is the conventions' **Version Control** rules — read them with the
other conventions in step 2 above, following the conventions index to wherever they live. A repository has one
history however many modules it has, so expect them at the level that binds all of them. Where a stage below says
"commit per the Version Control policy," those rules are what it means.

**Missing or silent means no commits.** Never invent a commit policy.

**Another plan may be running beside yours, and its commits land in the same history.** That is a constraint on
the policy, not something you resolve: rules written for one plan at a time may need to say how a commit is
scoped, and what to do when a concurrent one is mid-flight. Follow whatever they say and report a refusal they do
not cover, rather than improvising a scope or a retry.

## No Automatic Re-Review

A plan is reviewed once, by `plan-task`; the readiness gate above you may offer the user one more before you
start. Editing it afterwards triggers no second pass, not even when a mid-run blocker forces a change. When a
step agent reports a plan defect, record it in the **Run Log** and fix the plan text in place. Do not spawn a
review to confirm it.

## Stage 1 — Stabilization

Covers the plan's **Stabilization** group — its **API Contract**, **Database**, and **Interface-First / Build
Stabilization** sections, in that order. Spawn **one `stabilization-step` agent** for the whole group, on the
execution model, passing the plan path, every item id in listed order, the ids of the red steps whose scenarios
the stubs must agree with, the module's baseline figures and the conventions. What it may and may not do is
`stabilizing.md` in the `templates` directory beside the skills — the agent reads it as its brief; you verify
against it below.

**Stabilization guardrail** — verify yourself before ticking. Tick each item the agent reports done;
`plan.sh block` the rest with the reason it gave, and record every widened boundary it reports in the **Run
Log**. The checks:

1. **`stabilizing.md`'s *Done means***, run yourself with the conventions' commands against the baseline figures
   you were given. Read the skip list itself, not its size: every entry must name a step in the plan.
2. **Intent comments present and consistent.** For every stub method a red-phase step covers — take the stub list
   from the agent's report and match it against the red steps' `covers:` lists — open the stub and confirm its
   intent comment exists and agrees with that step's given/when/then scenarios: the behaviour, the error cases,
   nothing contradicting the plan. A missing, vague or contradicting comment is re-delegated to
   `stabilization-step` before Stage 2 spawns a single red agent.

If any check fails for a reason caused by this plan's changes, re-delegate to `stabilization-step` until it holds.
If it fails for a reason **unrelated to the plan**, apply the [Unrelated Failures](#unrelated-failures--report-dont-fail) rule.

Once the guardrail holds, commit per the Version Control policy.

## Stage 2 — RED Phase (parallel)

Covers the plan's **Red Phase** group — its **TDD Unit Red Phase**, **TDD Integration Red Phase**, and **TDD
System Test Red Phase** sections. Writing tests has no cross-dependencies — the stubs they compile against all
exist after Stage 1 — so:

- Collect the unchecked items across all three red sections — `plan.sh next --group red` lists them, and reports
  the stage finished rather than rolling into Green — and spawn them in waves under `waves.md` in the `templates`
  directory beside the skills: bundled by grouping and layer, capped by the conventions, verified by the agent
  alone or by you once per wave, ticked per step ID.
- Spawn each bundle on the agent matching its layer, passing every one of its steps' context (target class, test
  class, covered methods, the given/when/then scenarios and the `update:` bullets verbatim) and the module
  conventions:
    - unit steps → `tdd-unit-red-phase-step`
    - integration steps → `tdd-integration-red-phase-step`
    - system steps → `tdd-system-red-phase-step`
- When a report comes back, carry two of its lists into the plan before ticking: every `added:` case becomes a
  scenario sub-bullet under its step, marked `(added)`, so the plan stays the record of what the suite holds;
  every `left:` entry whose reason names a plan defect — a premise that fits no test, a consequence that does not
  follow — goes in the **Run Log** like any other defect a step agent reports. A `left:` entry that merely says
  the premise did not hold there needs nothing.

**Per-step guardrail**: the test classes written **compile cleanly and fail at runtime**. A red test that passes
against a stub is as much a defect as one that doesn't compile — it means the test asserts nothing — with one
exception: tests asserting the *absence* of behaviour (e.g. "no exception is thrown") may legitimately pass
against a no-op stub, and are listed as expected passes rather than reworked. Production code must not be touched
in this stage.

**Stage guardrail — RED exit check**: once every item is ticked or recorded as blocked, run `red-exit.md` in the
`templates` directory yourself. Do not start Stage 3 until it holds for every non-blocked item.

Once the check holds, commit per the Version Control policy.

## Stage 3 — GREEN Phase (unit + integration parallel, system last)

Covers the plan's **Green Phase** group — its **TDD Unit Green Phase**, **TDD Integration Green Phase**, and **TDD
System Test Green Phase** sections.

Ordering constraint: green steps run in parallel **except where the plan declares a dependency**. A green step
may carry `after:` naming other green target classes its tests exercise as real, unmocked collaborators (e.g. an
integration adapter whose execution path runs through a mapper implemented at unit level, or a usecase whose unit
tests use a real domain entity another unit step implements) — such a step cannot go green before those steps are
done. **System green depends on everything** (a system test drives the full stack — usecase logic *and* adapters
must exist), so it starts only after every unit and integration green item is ticked. The final production
implementation lands here.

1. Take the unchecked items of **TDD Unit Green Phase** and **TDD Integration Green Phase** as one batch and
   schedule it in **dependency waves**:

   ```
   plan.sh next --group green --section unit --section integration
   ```

   That is the scheduler: it lists exactly the items whose `after:` dependencies are all ticked, so re-running it
   after each tick is what reveals the next wave. Never spawn a step `next` does not list. The two `--section`
   flags keep system green out of this batch: a system item depends on everything by position, not by `after:`,
   and would otherwise come back eligible in the first wave.

   Each wave runs under `waves.md`, as in Stage 2 — bundled, capped, verified once, ticked per step ID, a blocked
   step's dependents never spawned. Unit items run on `tdd-unit-green-phase-step` and integration items on
   `tdd-integration-green-phase-step`, each passed its step context and the module conventions.
2. Wait until every item in the unit + integration batch is ticked or recorded as blocked. Tick items as they
   succeed; run the module's unit and integration suites once the batch is done and confirm both are fully green
   before proceeding. Once green, commit per the Version Control policy (if its granularity commits per wave —
   otherwise this checkpoint is a no-op and the commit happens at stage end).
3. Only then run the **TDD System Test Green Phase** steps — **sequentially, one sub-agent at a time, in plan
   order**, on `tdd-system-green-phase-step`. These fix remaining production bugs until the
   system tests pass; they never modify test classes. System green steps are never parallelized: their fixes may
   land in any production layer, and two entry points routinely share a usecase or an outbound adapter — parallel
   agents would race on the same production files. The one-class-one-agent rule only protects steps whose write
   scope is one class; a system step's write scope is the whole stack. Spawn the next step only after the previous
   one's report is in and its item is ticked (or its blocker recorded), passing along which production classes
   earlier system steps already modified.

**Per-step guardrail**: every test in the step's test class passes.

Once every green item (unit, integration, and system) is ticked or recorded as blocked, commit per the Version
Control policy.

## Stage 4 — Refactor (single sub-agent, whole diff)

Runs only when every unit, integration,
and system green item is ticked (blocked items excluded — a partially blocked plan still gets its completed part
refactored) and the module's full suite is green.

The diff is **this plan's, so one module's**. A task with several plans gets one refactor pass each, under that
module's own conventions — never one pass across two stacks, which is a diff no single set of refactoring
conventions describes.

Spawn **one** `tdd-refactor-phase` sub-agent for the entire plan — never in parallel with anything **in this
pipeline**; another module's pipeline is unaffected and keeps running. Pass it:

- the **diff scope**: every production and test file this plan created or modified, compiled from the plan's step
  targets plus the file lists in the step agents' reports (and a version-control diff against the pre-plan
  baseline, if one is available);
- the plan file path (read-only context);
- the module conventions, including the **Refactoring Conventions** section — a module without that section is
  fine (the agent falls back to its defaults plus the style sections); pass whatever style sections exist.

**Stage guardrail** — verify yourself after the agent reports: the full suite is green with the **same test count**
as before the stage (a changed count means a test was lost or duplicated), and the architecture-enforcement test
passes (extractions may have created or moved files). This stage changes no behavior and ticks no checkboxes — if
the agent reports blocker-level findings (a suspected bug the tests missed, an over-specified test), record them
in the **Run Log**.

Once the guardrail holds, commit per the Version Control policy.

## Stage 5 — Wrap-Up and Whole-Plan Guardrail

**Your wrap-up ends at your plan.** Archiving the task directory, and whatever the conventions run over finished
work, belong to the level that spawned you — they are about a directory you cannot see, and they take an archived
plan you never produce. Do steps 1 to 3 and report.

Your plan's **Post-Implementation Steps** group is a different list, and it is yours: checklist items inside the
plan, written for this task.

1. Implement the plan's **Post-Implementation Steps** group, in section order, one sub-agent per section.

   **An item an Open Question authorized carries that question's answer verbatim.** The checklist item is a
   summary written when the answer arrived; the answer is what the user actually asked for, and the two drift in
   exactly the direction that drops half of it. Quote the `- A:` text into the prompt, and before ticking the
   item, read what was produced against that text rather than against the item. The same holds for any
   `- Action:` on a Review Finding that prescribes content.
2. **Whole-plan guardrail** — run yourself, from the conventions' commands: the module(s) fully compile, the
   architecture-enforcement test passes, and **the entire test suite is green** — not just the classes this plan
   touched. If the module conventions name a **coverage guardrail**, run it here too — this is the first point at
   which every step exists, so it is the only point where a coverage figure means anything. Coverage below the
   minimum is a blocker: spawn a step agent for the tests that close the gap, or record why in the **Run Log**.
3. Commit per the Version Control policy, then **report your plan complete**. Leave the task directory exactly
   where it is. Whether the task as a whole is finished is a fact only the level above can see, and archiving on
   the first plan to finish would move the directory out from under a run still writing to it.

   If unchecked items or blockers remain, say so instead: what is open, and why.

## Unrelated Failures — Report, Don't Fail

The baseline taken above you guarantees the run starts green, so this rule covers failures that surface
**mid-run** yet turn
out to be **unrelated to this plan** (verify: it reproduces on a code path this plan never touched, or is clearly
environmental/flaky). In that case:

- do **not** treat it as a stage failure and do **not** abandon the run — continue with the plan's own work;
- do **not** silently fix it either — unrelated fixes don't belong to this plan's diff;
- record it in the **Run Log** with enough detail to reproduce (test name, error, suspected cause), and call it
  out in the final summary.

## Out of Scope

- Any plan but yours.
- Any module but the one your plan implements.
- Archiving the task directory.
- Whatever the conventions run over finished work — your plan's **Post-Implementation Steps** are yours; that
  list is not.

## What To Report

- Stage-by-stage progress, inside the one report you return at the end: what was spawned, what came back,
  guardrail results. Not a message per stage.
- A final summary the level above can act on: sections completed, test-suite status, the suite's final total and
  skipped counts, and every blocker or unrelated failure with the item ID it belongs to.
