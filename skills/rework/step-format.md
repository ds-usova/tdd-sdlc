# The step format

The grammar of a rework's checklist, read by `rework.sh` and by the agent applying a step. When each kind is
used, and what proves it, is [`applying-a-step.md`](applying-a-step.md).

Every step carries an ID, its kind, and one clause of what it does. IDs are `R01` upward across the whole rework,
assigned once, never renumbered.

**`rework.sh validate` checks the result** — a duplicate ID, an unrecognized kind, a line the kind does not
take, a line the kind owes, a placeholder value, a `files:` with no bullet under it, a `survives:` naming no
tier, a `needs:` or `disables:` naming a step nothing defines, an Open Question with no answer, a fenced block
that never closes, a missing log, a Run Log or an Attempts section, or a `B` or `A` entry, in the steps file, and a `B` entry in the log outside
its Run Log, numbered below the one before it, or naming no step the steps file defines. Run it on every steps file before handing the rework over, and
again after writing any answer. The script ships with the skill at `scripts/rework/rework.sh` — under
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` when installed as a plugin, under `.claude/` in a plain checkout.

A step given up on keeps its row and its open box, with `abandoned — <why>` at the end of its header;
`status` counts it closed and lists it apart from the open ones.

```
- [ ] R01 · extract · <what moves, and where to>
  - files:
    - `path/to/A`
    - `path/to/NewB`
  - test-files:
    - `path/to/NewBTest`
  - frozen: `ATest`
  - cover: `NewBTest`

- [ ] R02 · tests · <what is restructured>
  - test-files:
    - `path/to/OneTest`
    - `path/to/TwoTest`
  - survives: <a scenario> · <what it runs against>
  - survives: <another scenario> · <what it runs against>
  - measures: <the number this step claims to move> <before> -> <after>

- [ ] R03 · pin · <what is now enforced, set, or dropped>
  - test-files:
    - `path/to/TheCheck`
  - needs: R02
  - proves: <the mutation and the failure it produced, or why there is none>

- [ ] R04 · stabilize · <the signature that moves>

    - `path/to/OneCaller`
  - test-files:
    - `path/to/OneCallerTest`
    - `path/to/SomeTest`
  - disables: `SomeTest#aMethod` — cleared by R05

| Line          | On which kinds  | Holds                                                                         |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `files:`      | all but `tests` | every production file the step may edit, one per bullet under the label       |
| `test-files:` | all             | every test file the step may edit, one per bullet under the label             |
| `runs:`       | `inline`        | what runs after it — its tests, and the layering check where a file relocates |
| `frozen:`     | `extract`       | what must stay green **and unedited** — the behaviour-preserved claim         |
| `cover:`      | `extract`       | the tests written for the moved code, each mutated; `none` where it owes none |
| `survives:`   | `tests`         | one scenario and what it runs against; one line per scenario                  |
| `measures:`   | `tests`         | the number the step's claim is about, before and after                        |
| `needs:`      | any             | the step IDs whose work this step's run needs to be green                     |
| `proves:`     | `pin`           | how the step was shown to hold                                                |
| `disables:`   | `stabilize`     | each test it turns off, and the step that clears it                           |
| `docs:`       | any             | the pages this step invalidates — none on most `inline` and `tests` steps     |

**A step whose claim is a number carries `measures:`.** Narrowing what a test boots is the case: every scenario
still runs and the suite is green whether it happened or not.

**`files:` and `test-files:` are the boundary**, plus whatever a mutation temporarily breaks and restores.
Anything outside is another step's. One path per bullet; the label line stays empty.

**`cover:` is mutated one test method at a time**, and only the methods this step wrote. Extracting into a class
whose existing tests already reach the moved body writes `cover: none`.

**`survives:` names behaviour, never a method.** "A proposal is accepted" survives being moved into a different
class under a different name; `whenAccepted_thenRecorded` does not.

**A scenario keeps what it was proven against.** Swapping the real thing for a mock changes what the test
proves, so it is asked under **Open Questions**. An answered `yes` is written into the line as
`<before> -> <after>`, with a `B` entry in the log's Run Log recording the change, and the step is then held to
what the line now says.

**A step in another steps file is named with that file** — `needs: shared/steps.md · R01`, or
`disables: `SomeTest#aMethod` — cleared by module-a/steps.md · R02`. Only `needs:` and `disables:` may cross,
and `validate` does not resolve what it cannot see. A bare ID always means this file, and `validate` refuses one
no step here defines. Given the rework's directory rather than one file, `validate` checks every file in it.

**`frozen:` is a claim about the moment its step ran**, so a later step may restructure the same class.

**A step carries `docs:` where its change is visible outside the code** — a port, a contract, a stored shape, a
configuration knob, an operation, or a conventions page whose rule the step invalidates.
